# Introduction
Hi everyone! My name is Evi Tarshis and I'm from Westport Connecticut. I am in the school of Arts and Sciences and my major is currently undeclared. I am taking a wide variety of classes so I can explore all the different fields before commiting to a certain major. 
I've always loved asking questions and getting to know things about people below the that might not seem so obvious. That's why I fell in love with journalism from the second I joined the school's newspaper in eighth grade. I continued working on it all throughout highschool and worked as an editor for the arts section of the paper my senior year. 
Besides journalism, I also took A.P. Statisitcs my senior year and loved it. That's why I was immediately drawn to this class by how it combined two of my favorite subjects. When I use to compare statisitcs and journalism to eachother I thought about them as polar opposites, statisitics being on the math side of the spectrum and journalism being more on the english side. This class is showing me however that the two are not opposites but are compliments of eachother, some would even say essential in order for either field to succeed. I'm excited to apply my statisitc skills into my writing through this course and beyond.
Another fun fact about me is that I love to travel and am looking forward to continuing once COVID is gone!

# Coronavirus Cases In The U.S. by Race
![coronavirus](https://github.com/evitarshis/evitarshis.github.io/blob/master/Coronavirus%20cases%20by%20race_ethnicity%20in%20the%20United%20States.png?raw=true]) The infographic above shows the different percentages of coronavirus cases by race. The data was collected by the Center of Disease Control and Protection (CDC) and raises questions about the inequalities of certain races. The data, however, is not generalizable to the entire population because it only represents the geographic areas that contributed data to them. The data comes from 5,260,799 cases across the U.S. The data shows a clear spike in certain races such as 29.% being Latino or Hispanic, 18.3% being Black and 43% being White. 

# Chartbuilder Bar Chart

The bar chart above displays the residence life of undergraduate students at Lehigh in 2019. As you can see, the majority of undergraduates live on campus in the residence halls but the amount of students who live off campus comes in a close second. Sororties and Fraternities hold the least amount of graduate students.

# Line Chart

The line chart above displays the difference of voter turnouts in Pennsylvania from 2011-2019. The y-axis spans from 7 million to 9 million in order to give a narrower understanding of the data. As you can see, the turnout of voters jumps significantly on years of presidential elections. The upcoming election is projected to break records for voter turnout so I thought it would be interesting to create this prior, in order to compare it with the data once the 2020 election is over.

The map above displays five different running trails in the Lehigh Valley. I love running so decided to choose my topic on the best trails in this area. Each icon on the map represents a different trail, including a decription of the trail and a photo. Each description provides you with a breif history of the trail along with the different features each obtain contains.
