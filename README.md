Hi everyone! My name is Evi Tarshis and I'm from Westport Connecticut. I am in the school of Arts and Sciences and my major is currently undeclared. I am taking a wide variety of classes so I can explore all the different fields before commiting to a certain major. 
I've always loved asking questions and getting to know things about people below the that might not seem so obvious. That's why I fell in love with journalism from the second I joined the school's newspaper in eighth grade. I continued working on it all throughout highschool and worked as an editor for the arts section of the paper my senior year. 
Besides journalism, I also took A.P. Statisitcs my senior year and loved it. That's why I was immediately drawn to this class by how it combined two of my favorite subjects. When I use to compare statisitcs and journalism to eachother I thought about them as polar opposites, statisitics being on the math side of the spectrum and journalism being more on the english side. This class is showing me however that the two are not opposites but are compliments of eachother, some would even say essential in order for either field to succeed. I'm excited to apply my statisitc skills into my writing through this course and beyond.
Another fun fact about me is that I love to travel and am looking forward to continuing once COVID is gone!
